The DS2 making pipleine currently reads egf files from sleep trials in a dataset and 
	returns DS2 info tables which are loaded into electrode position tables 
	also containing metadata about individual rats.

Uses the following code: 

gather data: 
-sleepData from getSleepData - for every dataset you want to get DS2 info from 
-spatData from getSpatData - for every dataset you want to get DS2 info from 
-rat_info table - metadata per rat that doesn't change 

main pipeline:
-run_get_DS2_wrapper 
-get_DS2_info
-get_DS2_from_egf
-extract_DS2_from_egf

ISSUES:

1. for mapping files the code needs to be run from the MatLabData folder
	change to filepath for the individual maps - add extra input in first function 
	- make sure these are stored somewhere logical.
